# discogs-revisualized
discogs.com wrapper for outer users with revisualized ui

It is my pet-project dedicated to enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of a cool site [discogs.com](https://www.discogs.com/). I try to provide a modern, stylish overlay that transforms current design into more visually appealing and user-friendly interface, without altering the original content and functionality.

Domain of the revisualization is __only__ other users' collections and wantlists. Not inner collections and all remaining functionality. Basically it is just a cool gallery of the music collection you have that is easy to show to your friends.

## Goals:
- [ ] Create new visuals for wantlist
- [ ] Create new visuals for collection
- [ ] Provide responsive layout
- [ ] Create some service with link shortenings that can store your layout settings before sending it to your friends

## TODO:
- [ ] Error handling when there is no permission to view wantlist/collection
- [ ] Error handling when rate limit is exceeded
- [ ] Generate background profile banner by username
- [ ] In wantlist entry icon that describes type of vinyl etc
